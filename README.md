# Social Security Number Guesser

This project is currently still in development. The end goal is to develop a method to estimate Social Security Numbers given birthdate, time, and location. I am using SQLite to manage the data.

Birth Data is a collection of data about births, some from the SSA and some from other sources. 

SSN-Raw-Data is a collection of the Highest Known Group Number files from the SSA.

**Next Steps**
After some research into the Death Master File, I have found a set of the files and will be using that as a source for machine learning along with the other data I've collected.
