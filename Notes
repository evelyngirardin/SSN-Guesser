# Day 1

Downloaded all my data and started working on cleaning it. Main things done
today was the creation of a function that accepts area numbers and returns
the location of which owns that area number and the beginnings of reading
the area number files.


# Day 2

Finished up the cleaning function from Day 1 and have the first April file
in a cleaned CSV. Time to do it to all of them. I also edited how this function
finds the first row of integers, as the text files are not consistent in where
they start. Further, did some path management and reorganized the folders.
Finally, ran the functions on all the raw data and now have all the data
organized and formatted into new folders. Tomorrow I'll try to compress all the
data gained from this into a cleaner and shorter form.


# Day 3

Started work on the reading function and got it to read a cleaned data file
and return the list of states and their highest group numbers. Main issue is
some states started at 99 in Nov 03, and I am unsure how the SSA handled their
social security numbers. I found a copy of the Death Master File and want to
search through it to see if South Carolinans already were at 99. Maybe I could
send a message to the SSA to ask them about it?

I also found a website that gives the number of social security applicants by
year of birth and sex. https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/numberUSbirths.html
